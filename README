GEDCOM Format

The GEDCOM file format is very straightforward.  Each line represents a
node in a tree.  It looks something like this:

0 @I1@ INDI
1 NAME Justin Charles /Beck/
2 SURN Beck
2 GIVN Justin Charles
1 SEX M
...

In general, each line of the .ged file is formatted like this:

LEVEL TAG-OR-ID [DATA]

The LEVEL is an integer, representing the current depth in the tree.  If
subsequent lines have greater levels that the current node, they are
descendants of the current node.

TAG-OR-ID is a tag that identifies the type of data in that node, or it is a
unique identifier.  Tags are three- or four-letter words in uppercase. The
unique identifiers are always text surrounded by @ characters (such as
@I54@).  If an ID is given, the DATA is the type of the subtree that is
identified.

So, to tale apart the example given previously, you have this:

- 0 @I1@ INDI.  This starts a new subtree of type INDI ("individual").
  The ID for this individual is @I1@.

- 1 NAME Justin Charles /Beck/.  This starts a NAME subtree with a
  value of Justin Charles /Beck/.

- 2 SURN Beck.  This is a sub-element of the NAME subtree, of type SURN
  ("surname").
  
- 2 GIVN Justin Charles.  Same as SURN but specifies the given name of
  the individual.

- 1 SEX M.  Creates a new sub-element of the INDI element, of type SEX
  (i.e. "gender").

And so forth.

Variable white space is allowed between the level and the tag.  Blank
lines are ignored.

This module converts input (as GEDCOM) to XML.  The snipper of GEDCOM
given previously would become the following:

<gedcom>
  <indi id="@I1@">
    <name>
      Justin Charles /Beck/
      <surn>Beck</surn>
      <givn>Justin Charles</givn>
    </name>
    <sex>M</sex>
    ...
  </indi>
  ...
</gedcom>
