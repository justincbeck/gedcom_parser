1   NOTE This Gedcom file should only be used as part of the testsuite
2     CONC for Gedcom.pm (http://www.pjcj.net).  I have removed a
2     CONC lot of data from the original, and changed a few bits, so you
2     CONC should use the original if you want royal genealogy.  Contact me
2     CONC if you cannot locate the original.
